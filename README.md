# Distributed Photovoltaic System Capacity Estimation using Feeder Load Data based on Deep Learning

This repository contains the files and codes used to produce results presented in "Distributed Photovoltaic System Capacity Estimation using Feeder Load Data based on Deep Learning" by Lingxi Tang.

The descriptions of each code and file are written below. 


# Jupyter Notebook Code

#### Feeder Net Load Data Analysis
(See Section 4.2) Plots average 24-hour net load curve of specific season and intra-week groups

### Training Dataset Creation
Extracts averaged 24-hour net load curve from each week in an annual time-series dataset and subsequently extracts IFEEL features

### Hyperparameter Optimisation
(See Sections 5.1 and 6.1) This set of code was used to optimise hyperparameters for the ANN. 

### Season/Intra-week group Sensitivity Analysis
(See Sections
